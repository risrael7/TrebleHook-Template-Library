CCC - Summer Update

Redford Township District Library

Metal Studs & Drywall



The first Redford Township Library opened in 1945 and was originally housed in the fire hall. After years of relocation and redevelopment, the current library opened in 2004, thanks to a gift of 2.5 acres of land by the Presbyterian Village of Redford. The library has since been serving the people of Redford and is dedicated to its citizens, who provided funds for operations and the new building.

Commercial Contracting Corporation was contracted to provide interior services for a complete renovation of the library’s first and second floors. The work was split into (3) phases: Phase 1 included a new and reimagined youth space that includes a new Storytime room, dedicated programming space, (5) study rooms, a respite room, STEAM/computer area, interactive wall and more; Phase 2 included a new Friends of the Library Storefront, technology learning lab, (6) study rooms, quiet study space/computer area, new service desks, new staircase to second floor, and remodeled restrooms; Phase 3 included a reimagined teens space, upgraded computer area with copy center and help desk, updated lounge space, and (2) new group study rooms.

Our scope of work consisted of a unique river soffit that connects each “scene” on the second floor, providing a guide throughout the space. The soffit was prefabricated in 12-foot sections, improving safety, schedule, and quality. Before installation, our teams were able to outline the positioning and flow of the soffit on site, allowing the owner the opportunity to view the layout before it was installed. Around (20) panels were installed by hanging aircraft cable and connecting each section with connection plates. The soffit was fitted and drywalled, adding unique hidden lighting pockets along its entire length.

CCC also constructed temporary walls for each phase so the library could remain operational during the renovation. In addition to these temporary walls, our Interiors Services team also performed metal stud and drywall throughout the first and second floors, upgrading the first floor to a more modern aesthetic.

Construction Safety Week
In May, Commercial Contracting Corporation participated in Construction Safety Week 2024 focusing on Value Every Voice. This was extremely beneficial because it provided us with concepts that we can use to ensure safety, not only for ourselves but also for others.

Our job sites held numerous trainings, demonstrations, and appreciation events all week long to encourage, listen, and empower our teams. A big thank you to Werner Ladder Co, MSA, 3M, Iron Workers Local 25, and more for helping to build a stronger, safer industry!
